# Numpy Image Classification

## Overview:
### This is an image classification library created using NumPy and Pillow.
### NumPy is used to modify and transform large matrices using linear algebra operations.
### Pillow is used to transform an image into a NumPy array.
### All the code used to create the web server gui is not required to use this library.

## Build instructions:
### Clone the repository into a directory of your choosing.
### Install Python and pip if they have not been installed already.
### To install the required libraries, run these command for numpy, pillow, and flask: ```pip install library_name``` (ex: ```pip install numpy```).

## Usage Instructions:
### Run ```python main.py``` to use the console for image classification. You will be prompted to install the mnist dataset if it is not already in the imgs/ folder.
### Run ```python app.py``` to run a web server to use as your gui. If there are no directories in the imgs/ folder, I suggest installing the mnist dataset through the console.
